                Hello! I’m Erich, a software developer driven by a passion for creating innovative, user-focused solutions. With a strong foundation in web 
                development, I specialize in crafting applications that simplify tasks, enhance experiences, and create meaningful impact.

                My journey into technology began with my first university-level Computer Science course, sparking a fascination with problem-solving and the 
                endless possibilities of technology. Since then, I’ve honed my expertise in web development, working with frameworks like React and Angular, 
                backend tools such as Spring Boot and FastAPI, and database technologies including MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

                Currently, I’m a 4th-year Software Engineering student at the University of Victoria, seeking opportunities to apply my skills in the SaaS space. 
                My long-term goal is to contribute to projects that leverage technology to solve real-world problems and drive positive change.
